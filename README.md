The versioning helper package bundles a small set of helper functions & blade components,
to make updating & rendering your applications version & build number an ease.

Its aims at helping you to keep your applications version number up to date
& showcasing it within your applications to improve client feedback on support tickets.
The package supposes that you are using SemVer to version your application.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require swatty007/laravel-versioning-helper
```

## Configuration
After installing the package you can publish the configuration file via:
```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Swatty007\\LaravelVersioningHelper\\LaravelVersioningHelperServiceProvider"
```
It contains some optional configuration parameters and is fully documented.

## Usage
Simply add the following component to the desired location of your view:
```php
<x-versioning-helper::build-string></x-versioning-helper::build-string>
```
to display the full versioning information of your application, containing:
- Application Name
- Copyright Information
- Version Number

Alternatively you can also the following components separately, to display only a part of those information:
- x-versioning-helper::application-name
- x-versioning-helper::copyright
- x-versioning-helper::version

You can simply specify the current version of your application through our config file,
or through a user definable Cache variable, which can be set/updated via our fully documented versioning artisan command.
```php
php artisan versioning:helper --help
```

In addition to that the package will automatically try to look up the latest revision of our application
from your repository system of choice & append it as build number to your version string. (Unless configured otherwise!)
